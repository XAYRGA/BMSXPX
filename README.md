# BMSXPX - JAudio Engine Emulator / BMS Player 

Please note that you'll need my fork of SharpDX to use this until my PR is merged, you can find it here.  https://github.com/TheFreezebug/SharpDX . Alternatively, you can use the contents found in the "prebuilt" folder if you don't want to use it. 

Note that this CANNOT play back all sequences, this is a work in progress, that i don't know if it will ever be completed. 

The code is a mess, and difficult to read.
